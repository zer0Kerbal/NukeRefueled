// all parts are half meter size starting with tiny-huge being 0.25, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, and 4.0 in lenght
// the bent part is a latice that has a 90 degree curve with a 1 meter radius
// the spacer is a 0.175 long unit that is meant for center aligning station hubs
// all tankage integrates with this system for evenly spaced station construction.

Its 0.125 meters long so two of them joined are the same length as a tiny lattice section.
