	description = On a particularly hot day at the KSC, jeb decided to go get some fans to cool things down. What he came back with was a truck load of 60kw ducted fans. Not only did this make the KSC cool as a kukumber, it also flew blasted several kerbals out the front door and the fan out the back. Jeb put two and two together and built an all electic aircraft. It blew up but Jeb was ok.
