	description = Originally intended as an insanely large rcs thruster for insanely large ships, this small engine was meant to be a marvel of engineering. Unfortunately the engineer inexplicably pointed all 4 nozzels in the same direction, making it rather useless as a steering device. This 4 barreled engine gains second life however when it was found that it was capable of pusing a ship forward using only monopropellant. This was rather inefitient, a liquid fuel and oxidizer engine could do better. Then one day after Jeb attached some jumper cables to the engine, and bumped into the throttle. After it ran over night it was determined that the engine used less fuel. As with all things jeb himself builds, it blew up. But not before giving a more competent engineer an idea, and also a concussion. Now the engine features both modes, you can run it as an arcjet to save fuel, or you can use it as a regular monoprop engine and produce more thrust.
