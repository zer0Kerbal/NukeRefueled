	description = Because of a need for atmospheric vtols to have attitude control thrusters, and the cost, limited supply, and explode happy properties of monopropellant, a new system was needed. By taking bleed gasses from a jet engine and piping it to nozzles like this one, nearly limitless rcs thrust is now available for vtols (provided its engine is fitted with a bleed system and there is something to bleed). This thruster works best in the atmosphere.
