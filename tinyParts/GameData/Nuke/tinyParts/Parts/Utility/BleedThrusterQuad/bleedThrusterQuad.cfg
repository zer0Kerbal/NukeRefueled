	description = Inspired by using bleed air to provide attitude control thrust in the atmosphere, and a surplus of high tempurature tubing, it is now possible to do the same thing for purely rocket based vtol engines. When paired with an engine with a bleed exaust feature, this thruster provides attitude control without the need for an additional fuel source. So long as the vtol engine is running, hot gasses from the combustion chamber will be used to provide the needed reaction mass. This engine is optimized for zero atmosphere environments.
