// nukemod (i call all my mods this for some reason)
// half meter battery
// tank model volume is 0.09 (0.625m) 0.7 (1.25m) 5.64 (2.5m) (0.05 m^3 with old math)
// larger tanks increase mass and power density by a factor of 8 (geometry is awesome)
// balence by mass and capacity, using an e/m of 17500, which is within the range of stock battery parameters
// todo, figure out how to change the emmissive color of the decal based on which part cfg is used (while using the same model and textures)
// now with science!
