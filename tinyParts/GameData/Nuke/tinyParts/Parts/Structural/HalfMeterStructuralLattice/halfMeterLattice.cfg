// **** = 'Tiny', 'Small', 'Medium', 'Large', 'Huge', 'Bent', and 'Spacer'
// all parts are half meter size starting with tiny-huge being 0.25, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, and 4.0 in lenght
// the bent part is a latice that has a 90 degree curve with a 1 meter radius
// the spacer is a 0.175 long unit that is meant for center aligning station hubs
// all tankage integrates with this system for evenly spaced station construction. 
// also has a 0.125 long docking port, which can be used in place of the 0.25m spacerto join up disconnected bits.

// weight .25 for large (2/3 of the large stock truss, since its a 3m truss and the large is 2m)
// fudged density is 0.16812373907195696032279757901816

Its 0.125 meters long so two of them joined are the same length as a tiny lattice section.
