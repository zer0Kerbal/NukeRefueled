	description = This is an electric-xenon thruster that provides attitude control for your spacecraft, but with much better fuel economy! This thruster scares the xenon out of the nozzel by threatening to zap it with a tazer, then when it leaves the nozzel it zaps it anyway so it doesnt come back for revenge. Its not as powerful as other rcs thrusters, so just use more of them.
