	manufacturer = The Death Cult of Jeb
	description = Experimental solar powered wings for experimental solar powered aircraft. Upper surface has membrane solar cells integrated into the composite structure, and inside the wing contains a number of batteries and a charge controller. Because of all these goodies, it's a little heavier than other wing systems. Do not lick the terminals while in direct sunlight. Unlike other wings this is a single unit that attaches to the top of your plane, so that it gets more sun (and not because the engineer that made it got stumped). Should also point out that one of the engineers connected the control cables wrong, so those alerons are actually elevators, so dont get yourself killed.
