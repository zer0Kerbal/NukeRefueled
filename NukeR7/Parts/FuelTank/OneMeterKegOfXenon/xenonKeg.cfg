	description = Cult keggers... erm... uhm... meetings, yea thats it, meetings usually result in a large number of empty beer kegs. As a result for numerous pranks involving beer, rockets, and other unmentionable-in-good-company antics, these beer kegs have become loaded with xenon. And because the standard beer keg is about a meter wide it doesnt take a rocket scientist to attach it to a rocket. That is to say it helps, but is totally not neccisary.
