	manufacturer = The Death Cult of Jeb
	description = Long ago Kerbal scientists discovered that pirates emit a gas called Arrrghon. For a long time nobody could figure out what to do with the stuff. That is until The Cult tried to build an engine to use it. This proved difficult because the gas just wont burn, that is until His Honerable Boommaster Jeb brought his tazer to one of the Cult Gatherings. While attempting to zap Bob, The Low One, Jeb hit an arrrghon tank instead, which caused it to rocket across the room, taking out a sacremental beer keg and a deli tray. The engine ended up using insane amounts of power but at least we found a use for all the Arrrghon emmitted by Kerbal pirates over the years. It was later discovered that the scientists were wrong and that gas coming out of pirates is really xenon.
