nukemod for ksp
i went there

current version: 6ish
aka r5

warning: this readme file may cause cancer. side effects include: unquenchable bloodlust, self destructive tendencies, rectal bleeding, funny colored urine, intense sexual attraction to spiny life forms (like cacti, porcupines, hedgehogs, etc), and hypergolic flatuence that detonates when exposed to air. use at your own risk.

changelog:
beta 1	  - initial release
beta 2	  - fixed normal maps for long and short tanks, and the nosecone
			mpd thruster overheat animation looks better now
			mpd thruster now produces less heat and is less prone to self destruction
			mpd thruster weight reduction from 1.2 to 0.8
			gimbal ranges reduced on mpd thruster and gimballed engine to compensate for bang bang control
			
gamma 3   - moar parts
			a lot more parts
			some of them even work
			new resources
			atmospheric bits
			some ships
			and a cockpit
			also no longer calling it a beta since i dont need a reason
			this version requires at least ksp v.18
			
delta 4   - 0.20 compatibility (now uses new mod heirarchy)
			all textures are now png
			NEW! structural lattice construction kit
			some parts now come in a larger sizes
			better colliders for parts that had bad colliders (like the cockpit and the tail boom)
			depricated arrrghohn, all hall thrusters and mpd engines now use xenon
			resized fuel tanks to more strict specifications to make them compatible with the new lattice elements
			rebalenced some parts (mono tank is a lot less useless now)
			atmospheric vtol engine can now be throttled more quickly
			*known issue* 0.20 broke the sound effects so that badass mpd thruster sound doesnt work
			
fred 5    - brought up to 0.23.5 (hincefourth releases will be named after pet rocks owned by my cats).
			all textures are now tga. squad, for the wrath of lucifer, use sane texture formats (like dxt1). 
			dublicate textures annexed!
			tech tree support (i think, i havent actually tested it).
			replaced bleed air and bleed gas with bleed system pressure, bleed thrusters are now interchangeable.
			reworked mpd thrusters, should now work more sanely (but still power hungry).
			all part cfgs now use MODEL{} and NODE{} instead of the old skool way.
			new particle effects. the mpd engines and arcjet (and i want to do the hall thrusters if i figure out how) now have exhaust effects.
			sounds work now and there are more of them (i apologize in advance for my horrible sound engineering skills).
			various balance tweaks.
			experimental: ducted fan and vtol engine now have working rotors (powered by firespitter).
			experimental: intakes may accept atmosphere with or without oxygen and produce appropriate resources (though i need to find a better way to do this).
			new parts:	small glider wing
						small delta wing (with fuel tanks)
						solar wings (with batteries and solar panels)
						small canard
						small tail fin
						small aerodynamic pylon
						dual mode (chem/electric) arcjet
						electric ducted fan
						
6ish	  - the quasi-maintained version that i use in my ksp installs. its got unresolved bugs due to not being maintained very well. also im tired of naming things.
			some of the new parts i teased about some years ago are finally in. i gave them crude textures and they actually didnt look too bad.
			these parts include the micro girders and engines. 
			some experimental stuff i forgot as a result to my state leegilizig marijuana.
			added module manager support somewhere so it should now gracefully handle having tweakscale and firespitter installed, or not.
			seeing about kcan support because maintaining mods is hard.
			
r7		  - aka 6ier. bugfix release. bugs fixed + new features thus far:
			fixed particles on my lf engines (they still suck)
			battery colors now supported through the varients system
			battery tweak scale support (patch removes larger batteries so as not to clutter the parts list)
			support for modular fuel through firespitter. supported tanks: jet fuel tank (patch removes oxy tank), all tiny girder tanks
			added fuel tanks to large and heavy tiny girders
			tiny girders now sorted into appropriate categories
			failed attempt to fix particles with smokescreen (great plugin but without working particle spewers its kind of pointless)
			fixed some particles on the arcjet so as not to spew out when the engine not running/out of fuel/shut down (still needs work because the particles suck)
			more time wasted trying to get particles to do what i want
			attach points installed in tiny girders, still not doing what its supposed to.
			updated the readme file, forgot to change its name to reflect the current wip release.
			revamped the part list, added icon for tiny girders. yes i used comic sans, deal with it.
			re-exported some models under the newer part tools.
			fixed rcs nosecone thrusters, changed to rcxfx. Still needs fucking particles.
			fixed tiny mpd thruster, flames now stick to the emmitter. 
			fixed tiny monoprop thruster, particles spewed when the engine was out of gas.
			fixed some bad sound effects on many of the ion thrusters (replace all AUDIO_MULTI_POOLs with AUDIO).
			the ducted fan was a little op (reduced to 15 kn and dropped the power consumption to 12).
			fixed the sounds on the bleed thrusters. todo find a sound effect that sounds like the blast from a compressor valve being opened
			
			todo:
			particles, fix them
			the jet engine is way too op. dispite the fact that max thrust is only set to 75kn. curve problem.
			vtol jet engines busted. likely an intake problem
			particle effects also broke on both the vtol rocket and jet engines. go figure.
			solar wings are a huge derp, fixxor them.
			make some shitty textures for the ducted fan and other parts that i forgot to texture
			some of the thrusters on the rcs nosecone dont have any sounds
			fix the girder attach points again
			
			parts i still want:
			finish the 10 meter centrifuge module
			monoprop apu (will convert monoprop to electric charge, if theres atmosphere, it will also make bleed pressure)
			open cockpit seat
			half meter storage container
			half meter landing gear
			mini ducted fan (about a quarter the size of ha half meter but with the intake attached, would also surface attach)
			fuel hoses for the mini girders, possible tanks for the lattice. maybe also visible alternate tank configs.
			turn the 30 m expanding round thing into a solar panel
			add helostats to solar wing and make surface transparent
			textures on everything that needs textures
			
			
			
		

license: 
the nihilist's license terms are follows:



that concludes the license terms. i dont make mods because i give a fuck how the world wants to self organized nor will i be a part of it. its free stuff, enjoy it.
ok the license is really public domain, its really all the same. pirate this mod. 

im going to abandon this stuff one day so i figure id cut out the middle man and just put it in public domain where it belongs. but plese dont be a dick about it (see 'psychotic rant' below). 
dont claim it as your own. i would like the common curtousy of being in the credits. this is what the profesionals do. this is the kind of shit that made me leave the freespace community.

installation:
move the 'Nuke' directory into your KSP_Root/GameData/ folder. 
optionally you may copy the 'Ships' directory to KSP_Root, if you want to use my shoddy craft files. at least you can do that if i get around to making new craft files,
i lost the old ones to a drunken rage.

description: 
this pack contains the following parts, none of them use any plugins yet 
*note* was too lazy to update this so some stuff got renamed

ships									description
--------------------------------------------------------
MicroFlier								a small jet, light but not very stable
MicroGlider								a small glider, use the srbs to get some altitude, and glide around for awhile, its hard to get back down, with its epic glide slope and all
MicroSpacePlane							a small space plane capable of reaching orbit, easier to fly than the old one, but no mpd so no duna for you.
MicroVtol								a small (seems we got a theme going on here), this is a ship that can take off vertically. its hard to control (do yourself a favor and stick a mechjeb pod on it, really)
Ultralight Vtol							a cute litle vtol, can fly autonomously or can seat 2 kerbals (but not one)
Ultralight Vtol (zero atmo edition)		same as this ^ but with rockets instead of turbines
Some Kind Of Monster					c-c-c-c-c-c-c-c-combobreaker! A ship to show off the new lattice system, has a lot mpd thrusters, and a lot of solar panels. though probibly not enough (todo: nuclear reactor). 

*note* didnt feel like updating the star serpant, too many batteries!

notes:
i use the nuke_ prefix for all my part folders, at least i used to, now i just put everything inder GameData/Nuke
i use 7zip because it offends those who shouldnt be allowed to use computers or rather i dont because spaceport dont support it, i might use it again if i go 
back to google drive. ha! really its better than zip, just be glad its not a tarball. 

about the mod:
i started this pack around ksp .13, but discontinued work until i had the cash to buy the game. it mostly contains half meter parts which i kinda thought were
lacking in the mod packs that were out at the time. recently started adding normal maps and converting to the new mu format, thowing in some new parts here
and there. the only part that isnt normal mapped is the Undeviginti Coupler, for which i seem to have lost the source textures, so i couldnt remove baked in 
highlights and replace it with dynamic higlights. i may redo this texture as it kinda looks bland without normal maps. disreguard this paragraph its really old. 

there may be some issues with balence. initially i estimated tank capacity and engine thrust by examining stock parts, and then tweaked it with the ikao calculator
but it seems that balence guidelines are sketchy at best and not well defined. so i will tweak things for balence when i get better guidlines. 

ive had some issue with connecting the radial decoupler and the radial adapter to some of the stock parts, ive tweaked it abit but it may still be wonky.

after the initial and subsequent fixup beta releases the game got updated again and broke everything. instead of just fixing all the parts and rebalencing it, i
more than doubled the number of parts. while the new parts dont have cool stuff like normal maps (this really isnt an issue because noone liked my normal maps 
anyway), there are a lot of them. after getting them modeled, textured, unityed, part moduled, fixed, broken, and fixed again, here they are, in their
buggy glory. 

ive yet to come up with a name for the mod pack. i guess i could use nukemod, after all i call all my other mods that. im supprised people arent confused yet.
ive considered making a bunch of useful advertising pics to get people interested in my mod. i tell you back in my day we didnt need no advertising to download
every mod there was. we clogged our 56k modems with mod downloads, we could play em faster than we could download em. these days all theese a.d.d whipersnappers
with their 50 megabit internet connections, energy drinks, and violence free education systems wont touch one byte of mod content, without being convinced they
are not wasting their time even reading about it. whatever happened to those days of hex editing new bad guys into games that only had 2 and a half dimentions?

wait what did i loose track again? anyway as i was saying my mod has no name, so you can call it nukemod if you want, or you can call it that mod pack with the
dinky parts, you can call it fred for all i care. 

i updated my mod but didnt want to throw away good material so i left all the stuff up there so you can read it if you are really desperate for something to do. 
frankly most of it is bullshit and not worth your time. but its full of really old information and will probibly give you cancer if you printed it out and
smoked it. 

future plans:
up till now if i needed a part rather than spending hours browsing for a mod that did what i want, id instead spend hours making those very parts. it seems to 
have worked for now. the future may have me make some more parts, there are still things i want. like open cockpits and better power supplies. maybe even write
code for features like fps interiors, centrifuges, and intakes that know what they are breathing. ksp is not really a high priority, its fallend behind my 
hardware projects in terms personal interest. and i also have games like minecraft and mechwarrior online whoring up all my time. and thats when i can find time
and provided im not stoned at the time. i have a lot of cats too so they distract me. im going to add this to kcan and maybe il do periodic updates, which is 
really just me adding to this horrendeous tome and dropping the zip on my google drive. 

psycotic rant (reading this will cause cancer):
if i wanted to speak legalese i woulda gone to law school and wouldn't have had time to make this mod. you use it you credit me! i cant believe in a world 
where you need a fucking licens just to get people to pay you the common fucking courtesy of citing you as their source when they derive shit from your crap.
you did this in colledge you would get expelled. its public domain now, but dont be a dick about it. if you use my stuff its nice to have my name in your
credits. hell even disney (who makes a fortune revisioning public domain works) does this. and these are the same people who keep pushing copywrite periods
towards infinity, ensuring nothing ends up public domain. and if hippocrites like disney can credit creators of public domain works whom they base their shitty
movies off of, you can too. proove that you are better than the mouse! the alternative was a "hunt you down and kill you if you did something i dont like" clause, 
but i thought it wouldnt fly too well in the ksp community. not like it doesnt always apply though. support anarchy (or at least my global empire)! legalize 
murder! tear down licensing infrastructure, commit acts of violence against copywrite organizations. burn down the patent office. line the streets with the
impaled corpses of copywrite lawyers. vivisect the rich copywrite holders who piss all over the public domain. join your local pirate party and steal all the
things. ok that wasnt part of the licens just so you know, public domain was it. i dont belive in intellectual property. you cant really call it intellectual 
anyway, i was stoned when i made most of it. i dont own anything anyway. both concepts are alient to me. this tldr paragraph is also public domain btw. im on
new meds. 

about nuke:
nuke is kind of a hermit who can model, texture, script, program (c/++, lua), hack, engineer, design electronics, build robots and make a mean meatloaf. he is
an old time modder and has moded the following games: descent2, quake, quake2, freespace 2, freelancer, and now ksp. however he rarely releases anything, so
be honored that he chose ksp and actually released a beta. he is also a raving lunatic and plans to vaporise the earth in thermonuclear hellfire. nuke does not
use the internet so dont try to contact him. he wont ask for money but he will drink all your booze if you let him near your liquor cabinet. dont let him near
your mom either, he likes mature fat women. he also likes cats.

*readme only contains 27% new content and should not be taken internally.

**hey at least this readme was a better read than a linux man page.
