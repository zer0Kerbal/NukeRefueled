        todo:
            * particles, fix them
            * the jet engine is way too op. dispite the fact that max thrust is only set to 75kn. curve problem.
            * vtol jet engines busted. likely an intake problem
            * particle effects also broke on both the vtol rocket and jet engines. go figure.
            * solar wings are a huge derp, fixxor them.
            * make some excrementsty textures for the ducted fan and other parts that i forgot to texture
            * some of the thrusters on the rcs nosecone dont have any sounds
            * fix the girder attach points again
            
            parts Nuke still wants to add:
            * finish the 10 meter centrifuge module
            * monoprop apu (will convert monoprop to electric charge, if theres atmosphere, it will also make bleed pressure)
            * open cockpit seat
            * half meter storage container
            * half meter landing gear
            * mini ducted fan (about a quarter the size of ha half meter but with the intake attached, would also surface attach)
            * fuel hoses for the mini girders, possible tanks for the lattice. maybe also visible alternate tank configs.
            * turn the 30 m expanding round thing into a solar panel/radiator
            * add helostats to solar wing and make surface transparent
            * textures on everything that needs textures
